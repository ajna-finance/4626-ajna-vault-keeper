# Optional: define the minimum severity of logged events during keeper run (info, warn, error).
# Defaults to info.

# Optional: abort keeper run if optimal bucket has a bankruptcy timestamp between this value and the current time.
# Must be in seconds.
# If set to zero, keeper will exit if the bucket has ever been bankrupt, regardless of how much time has passed since the bankruptcyTimestamp.
# Defaults to 72 hours (in seconds).

# Optional: only consider auctions with bad debt if they are older than this value.

# A CoinGecko API key is not strictly required for the rate of queries made by this keeper.

# This keeper is designed to use Chronicle's onchain price feeds as a backup oracle if a Chronicle address is configured.
# 
# The onchain feed can be set as the primary oracle, which will switch CoinGecko into the backup position.
# If ONCHAIN_ORACLE_PRIMARY is set to true, the ONCHAIN_ORACLE_ADDRESS is required, but ONCHAIN_ORACLE_MAX_STALENESS is optional.
# If ONCHAIN_ORACLE_PRIMARY is not set, the ONCHAIN_ORACLE_ADDRESS and ONCHAIN_ORACLE_MAX_STALENESS values are both optional.

# Optional: timestamps from Chronicle may come with future timestamps, due to small variations between machine and block timestamps.
# The keeper rejects future timestamps if they exceed the FUTURE_SKEW_TOLERANCE.
# Must be in seconds.
# Defaults to 2 minutes (in seconds)
FUTURE_SKEW_TOLERANCE=120
